"Sony SACS9 10"" Active Subwoofer",Sony,$158.00,3,"Put more punch in your movie soundtracks with the SA-CS9, 115W Home Theater subwoofer. Bring the energy and passion of the original performance home.

9.84 in active subwoofer for thumping bass
The 9.84 in cone diaphragm can move a larger volume of air, producing powerful low-end resonance that makes bass sound rich and authentic. The subwoofer reinforces low frequency sounds in movies and music for a great multi-channel home theater experience.

Mica Reinforced Cellular conem undistorted audio
Many speakers use paper cones that flex and deteriorate over time, leading to a more distorted sound. Mica Reinforced Cellular (MRC) fiber woofers are rigid, holding their shape even when moving at high pressure and speed, so you can drive the bass harder without compromising audio quality.

Power every beat with a built-in amplifier
Drive bass-heavy music and bring your party alive. This subwoofer includes a built-in amplifier with up to 115 W power output. Electrical circuits susceptible to vibration are located outside the cabinet, releasing high pressure within the enclosure for a clear and powerful bass sound.

Minimizing vibration for tight bass
Suppressing vibration in the cabinet is vital for tight, accurate bass. Unwanted vibrations are handled in two ways: by acoustically absorbing waves generated from the rear pressure of the unit, and damping vibrations within the cabinet itself.

Smart finish for style and substance
This speaker has a smart black finish that blends with most contemporary interiors. The wood veneer also retains its shape well, ensuring that the sound won’t be influenced by changes in temperature and humidity.

Compact design for small spaces
Powerful and compact, this subwoofer is perfect for easy installation in tight spots. Because of the reduced baffle area, the speaker minimizes sound field distortion for optimum clarity and precision.

General specifications:
Fully realize the depth of all your movie soundtracks with this 10 in (25 cm) freestanding subwoofer, compatible with High-Resolution Audio. Immerse yourself in a deep, responsive low to mid range with the mica-reinforced cone, and enjoy enhanced audio clarity thanks to the Bass Reflex design.

Denon AH-C720 In-Ear Headphones,Denon,$119.00,1,"Drawing on half a century of Denon headphone engineering experience, the new 2016 models are designed to combine comfort with no-compromise sound. Aimed at those who want the very best sound whether traveling, working or relaxing, the new in-ear models are packed with advanced Denon technologies, designed to deliver the best possible performance from compact, lightweight earphones.
The AH-C720, available in black and silver, uses an 11.5mm driver, mounted in housings combining die-cast aluminium and resin, designed for rigidity and vibration-damping. Denon’s Acoustic Optimiser technology helps equalizing the air-pressure in front of and behind the driver. It’s all part of making the sound as dynamic and distortion-free as possible.
The direct successor to the popular AH-C710, it’s designed for life on the move, with fibre-mesh cover on its cable for durability. Audio enthusiasts often complain about the noise generated from the cable rubbing against their chest when they’re moving. Denon’s specially designed Radial Cascade Damper system reduces cable-transmitted vibration noise, enabling you to enjoy studio-quality music on the go.
In addition, the AH-C720 is fitted with Comply TX400 ear-tips, which combine with the ergonomically-shaped housings to give a secure fit for the purest sound and maximum isolation from external noise. The tips use memory foam activated by the heat of the user’s ears, and have an integral wax-guard to keep the inside of the earphones clean. Four sizes of silicon ear-tips are also provided, along with a carrying case and cable clip.
To round up, the AH-C720 can be used with the dedicated Denon Audio Application for iOS and Android, allowing you to enhance the sound and tune it to suite your personal preferences. This app not only optimises the sound of portable devices, it also offers an improved player interface supporting queuing, and playlisting, and allows the user to access over 70,000 radio stations and 2 million on-demand programs via the TuneIn Internet Radio platform.
